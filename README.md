# Histogram equalization

It is applied to a gray scale image ,by using the histogram of the image
to enhance the image contrast.

# Normalization

### - We applied linear normalization (contrast stretching) by changing scale of pixels intensities to cover all range from 0 to 255

- For image that is shown below intentisties range from 6 to 200
  <img src="images/test.jpeg"  width="400" height="200"/>

- After applying normalization, intentisties range becomes from 0 to 255
  <img src="images/test_edit.jpeg"  width="400" height="200"/>

### - The differnce between two image is clear to bring the image into a range that is more normal to the senses
